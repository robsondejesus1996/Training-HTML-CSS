        <p class="apresentacao__conteudo_texto">
          I am a software engineer passionate about innovation and development.
          I hold a degree in software engineering and am currently pursuing two
          postgraduate degrees, one in Artificial Intelligence and the other in
          Full Stack Development. I have strong skills in various languages and
          frameworks, including Java, React JS, NextJS, HTML5, CSS3, PostgreSQL,
          and Python.

          For four years, I worked at Unidavi, where I held various roles, from
          support analyst to full stack developer. My responsibilities included
          providing user support for the Mentor Unidavi system, maintaining
          computers and network infrastructure, and developing systems using
          modern technologies. I also had the opportunity to teach robotics
          classes to young students in elementary school, an experience I highly
          value for its contribution to technological and educational
          development.

          I am seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my knowledge,
          face challenges with determination, and contribute my technology
          expertise to the company's growth. I believe in the power of teamwork
          and am ready to give my best to create impactful solutions.
